# 🎨 Design Update Instructions

## For Classmates: How to See the New Design

After pulling the latest changes from GitHub, follow these steps:

### Option 1: Development Mode (Recommended for Testing)

```bash
# 1. Pull the latest changes
git pull origin main

# 2. Install any new dependencies (if any)
npm install
cd client && npm install
cd ..

# 3. Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Then open: **http://localhost:5173**

---

### Option 2: Production Build (For Deployment)

If you're deploying to a live server:

```bash
# 1. Pull the latest changes
git pull origin main

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install
cd client && npm install
cd ..

# 3. Build the frontend
cd client
npm run build
cd ..

# 4. Start the production server
npm start
```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If you don't see the changes:

1. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows/Linux)
   - Press `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
   - Or open in incognito/private mode

2. **Make sure you're on the right branch:**
   ```bash
   git branch  # Check current branch
   git checkout main  # Switch to main if needed
   ```

3. **Check if the dev server is running:**
   - Look for "VITE ready" message in terminal
   - Frontend should be on port 5173
   - Backend should be on port 5000

4. **Restart the development server:**
   - Stop the server (Ctrl + C)
   - Run `npm run dev` again

## ❓ Still Having Issues?

Make sure:
