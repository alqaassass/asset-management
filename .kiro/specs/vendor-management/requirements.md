# Vendor Management Module - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Vendor Management module extends the IT Asset Management System by adding comprehensive vendor tracking, evaluation, and analytics capabilities. This module enables administrators to manage vendor relationships, track purchases, monitor performance, and make data-driven decisions about vendor selection and retention.

## Glossary

- **Vendor**: A company or supplier that provides IT assets to the organization
- **Purchase Order (PO)**: A commercial document issued to a vendor for asset procurement
- **Vendor Rating**: A performance score (1-5 stars) based on quality, delivery, and service
- **Vendor Category**: Classification of vendors (Hardware, Software, Services, Peripherals)
- **Vendor Reliability Score**: AI-calculated metric based on asset failure rates and performance
- **Total Spend**: Cumulative amount spent with a specific vendor
- **Asset-Vendor Link**: Foreign key relationship connecting assets to their suppliers
