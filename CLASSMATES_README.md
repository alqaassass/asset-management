## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Why don't I see the new design?

The design changes are in React code, which needs to be **compiled**. Just pulling from GitHub isn't enough!

**You MUST:**
1. Pull the latest code
2. Install dependencies (`npm install`)
3. Run the development server (`npm run dev`)

### Browser Cache Issue?

If you still see the old design:
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
- Or open in incognito/private mode

---

## 📋 Manual Setup (If Scripts Don't Work)

```bash
# 1. Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install
cd client
npm install
cd ..

# 3. Make sure PostgreSQL is running
# (Check if Docker container is running)

# 4. Start the server
npm run dev
```

---

## 🐳 Using Docker (Alternative)

If you have Docker installed:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Then open: **http://localhost:5000**

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Port already in use"
Someone else is using port 5000 or 5173. Stop other apps or change the port in `.env`

### "Cannot connect to database"
Make sure PostgreSQL is running:
```bash
# Check if Docker container is running
docker ps

# If not, start it
docker start asset-management-db
```

### "Module not found"
Run:
```bash
npm install
cd client && npm install
```

### Still not working?
1. Delete `node_modules` folders
2. Delete `package-lock.json` files
3. Run `npm install` again
